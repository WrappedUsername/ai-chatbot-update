# ü§ñ ChatGPT AI ChatBot Update v0.1.2 üöß Work In Progress üèó - WrappedUsername

```yml
My thoughts on the update:
```
- Add TypeScript config files etc.
- Add Docs and notes of the update.
- Make this work in VS Code terminal?? 
   - I want to try this, but I have no clue if I can do this,

IMPORTANT UPDATE: The SESSION_TOKEN solution no longer works (since the time I recorded my video). But, you can modify this code to use your username and password as a login, more details on how to do that along with the latest authentication strategies can be located here: https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api
